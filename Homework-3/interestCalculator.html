    <h1>Interest Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      For this assignment, you are going to use your knowledge of JavaScript to
      create an interest calculator. Everything you need to know to get this to
      work you have learned in class <i>except</i> for a couple of things. The
      rest of this document will explain in detail those things that you need to
      make this work properly.
    </p>
    <h2>Interest Calculation</h2>
    <p>
      Unless you have a secret passion for finances, you probably do not know
      the calculation for finding interest. Therefore, the formula below will
      help guide your assignment:
    </p>
    <p id="formula">Total = Principle(1+Rate*Time)</p>
    <p>
      <i>Principle</i> is the amount of money invested.<br />
      <i>Rate</i> is the interest rate you are receiving<br />
      <i>Time</i> is the amount of time the money will accrue interest. (In this
      case, you will use <i>years.</i>)
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>parseFloat</h3>
    <p>
      We haven't talked about getting numeric values from input elements. You
      will notice that it doesn't matter whether the input element is a text or
      number input element, it will result in a <i>string</i>. Go ahead and try
      it. I have included the following input elements to demonstrate this
      point. Click on the <b>Check Console</b> button after you input values in
      each text field:
    </p>

    <div>
      <label>Principle</label>
      <input type="number" name="tInput" id="p" /><br />

      <label>Interest Rate</label
      ><input type="number" name="nInput" id="i" /><br />

      <label> Time </label>
      <input type="number" name="nInput" id="t" /><br />

      <!-- <input type="button" value="Check Console" onclick="numStrings()" /> -->

      <input type="button" value="Calculate" onclick=" getTotal()" />
    </div>

    <p id="answer"></p>

    <br />
    <p>
      You can see on the page that even when I try to add the
      <i>number</i> values together, it treats them as strings. That is because
      they <em>are </em> strings. You need to convert them to integers before
      you can do any computations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, changing these string values to integers is fairly simple.To do
      this, we use <i>parseFloat</i>. This will turn our string numbers into
      real integers. To use parseFloat, your code will look something like this:
    </p>
    <code>var num1 = parseFloat(document.getElementById('nInput').value);</code>
    <p>Now click the <b>Add Values</b> button to see this in action.</p>
    <h3>Fixed Values</h3>
    <p>
      Also - if you would like your values to end in only 2 decimal places,
      simply add <i>toFixed()</i> after your variable with the number of decimal
      places you would like inside the parentheses.
    </p>
    <code
      >myNumber.toFixed(2) //Will result in two decimal places (ex. 5.00)</code
    >

    <p>
      Now you know everything you need to know to get started. This is what your
      calculator should look like after someone has entered values:
